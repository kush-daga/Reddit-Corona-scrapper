=======================

## Question:  What is the main reason I should decide it's time to go to the hospital with this?



I think the best guidance to ask yourself is: if this were any other disease, would I go to the hospitals with the symptoms I am having? If I have what feels like a Flu, I may have muscle aches and feel crummy, but if I’m still able to eat and drink and get some rest, I should stay home.  If, instead, I get really short of breath and can’t keep any food down, I’d definitely head in.  The same is true with suspected COVID. We don’t have the tools to treat the virus, as clinical trials are still underway. But we do have the tools to treat your body and its symptoms when you’re ill and getting dehydrated. 

There is still no objective clear definition, but to me it's if you are having a hard time breathing or feel awful. We are happy to see you and assess you in real-time, but keep in mind that the danger of this virus is that it causes Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome. 

TL;DR: come to the hospital if you feel really bad.
## Question:  Does the virus leave permanent lung damage in patients who needed hospitalization and recovered? Is it possible to be infected by the same strain again? how soon? will it be more severe the second time?

As with much of what we discussed today, data is limited. There is a case study from china following an infected patient who received antiviral treatment in the hospital. While the initial CT scan does show the lung scarring, by day 19 healing was shown and by day 31, there was complete resolution of the lung damage. 
**TL;DR It is unlikely. A study from China showed the damage healed after 31 days.**

## Question:  Describe "mild symptoms" are we talking a regular cold, maybe a flu? Or does mild mean realy bad but you don't need oxygen or a ventilator yet.


Let’s talk about symptoms. The largest study we have to date is from Wuhan and the Chinese WHO report. It’s actually quite interesting. Let’s take a look together:

**The most common symptoms are:** 

* fever (87.9%)
* dry cough (67.7%)
* fatigue (38.1%) - these are definitely “mild”

**The next most common were:**

* sputum production (33.4%)
*  shortness of breath (18.6%)
* sore throat (13.9%)
* headache (13.6%), 
* myalgia or arthralgia (14.8%) aka muscle aches or joint pains
*  chills (11.4%)
* nausea or vomiting (5.0%) - you might see these with the flu as well

**Things that seem to be quite rare:** 

* nasal congestion (4.8%)
* diarrhea (3.7%) 
* hemoptysis (coughing up blood) (0.9%)
* conjunctival congestion (0.8%) 

**Things we classified as very severe disease (about 13.8% have this)**

* dyspnea (shortness of breath while speaking)
* Breathing more than 30 breaths a minute
* blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, 
* Some lab data: PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours)

**6.1% are critical** (respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure)


**TLDR Mild really does mean mild, and runny nose/ runny eyes probably means you dont have COVID. If you're breathing fast or can't catch your breath while speaking, that is severe and you should be seen by a doctor immediately**

## Question:  What home medications should we and should we not be taking if we have the virus? (Cough syrup, albuterol etc)


/u/antiseptic123 [see my comment below here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fgy7rg/im_dr_ali_raja_vice_chair_of_the_department_of/fk87zjf/)

## Question:  If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 and make a successful recovery, can you get the virus again?

With many viral illnesses, a successful recovery means that most people won’t be reinfected, as the body has built up an immunity to the virus.  We sometimes see reinfection in patients who are ill or immunocompromised, but even that is rare.  With the flu, it actually has multiple strains so when there is “reinfection” it’s often a second infection with a different strain.  So, based on what we know so far, it should be very hard to be reinfected with COVID-19.  However, it’s important to emphasize that we really haven’t seen enough data to rule this out since not enough patients have fully recovered and then been re-exposed, and we’re all extrapolating at this point.
**TL;DR: You are unlikely to get reinfected...we think.**

## Question:  Why do we not have better information about some basic questions everyone has: 1) does recovering from covid-19 confer immunity, at least until the virus mutates? 2) are asymptomatic patients infectious? I’ve read conflicting reports and having a reliable source for this is important  3) does heat kill coronavirus? This seems like a simple piece of research that would be beneficial and assuage a lot of fears.  As we approach spring on the west coast, the temperature in cars is getting over 90F. As it gets even warmer it would be great to know if heat kills the virus. People can park in the sun to kill coronavirus in their cars, and leave the AC off during the day or all day as summer hits to kill coronavirus.

/u/backward_s 

1) This is a tricky question--I'll answer to say that there has been no evidence that people who get it once get it a second time (see our answer below). Thus to most people that would mean you have immunity. 

2) I have also read conflicing reports but my answer tends to be no.
The WHO notes that asymptomatic infection has been reported, but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease. It’s important to note that the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear since we aren’t yet widely testing asymptomatic patients, but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.

3) Heat doesn't kill it, but it does make it harder to spread. See my answer below about how long Coronavirus stays on surfaces. There is data that temps around 80-90 does make it harder to transmit.

## Question:  Hi Dr. Raja and Dr. He! So I live in Boston, I had a question about COVID-19 treatment. In some countries such as Italy, Netherlands, Iran, South Korea, and China -- among others -- we're hearing news that doctors use chloroquine and Remdesivir against COVID-19 patients. Recently, in a press release, China [claimed here](http://news.southcn.com/nfplus/gdjktt/content/2020-03/09/content_190536632.htm) that Chloroquine Phosphate healed patients on average 4.4 days (reddit discussion and translation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/ffztou/expert_chloroquine_phosphate_has_a_negative_time/)). However, we're hearing that US doctors will not be able to use these medicines since they're not FDA approved. Is it true that if I show up to Mass General Hospital with complications from COVID-19 doctors would be reluctant to use these medicines even though there is some (although not peer reviewed) evidence that they work in other countries. What will the process of using new drugs in the US look like. Is the roadmap in the order of weeks, or months or years i.e. if it's proved unequivocally that these are helpful drugs in treatment, how long will it take them to be approved in US so that doctors can give them to COVID-19 patients?


/u/BrokenWineGlass in the ER we aren't doing any experimental testing, but I can't comment about what's happening in the ICU as those are other doctors and other departments. As you can imagine trial drugs usually only get tested on the sickest of the sick--our first pledge as doctors was to do no harm. If you look healthy to me and otherwise well, I'd be really reluctant to give unproven medications, especially ones that have pretty significant side effects like Chloroquine, but thats my 2 cents. My job in the ER is to stabilize you, and we have known methods to do that mostly around ventilation and intubation to help your lungs function. That's my clinical experience. After that, I am an informed scientist and I would only know based on whats published.

## Question:  As a healthy, younger person (20-29), but with chronic asthma, am I at a higher risk? I have seen the percentage of fatalities for people with chronic respiratory illness being as high as 6.3%, which is significantly higher than the estimated fatality rate for my age group (0.2%). I have had a cough for the last week, but no fever, and doctor's office advised no need to self isolate. Should I be concerned?

EDIT: Thank you both for taking the time to engage with the general public on these difficult topics. We appreciate your expertise and candor.


/u/4AKlondike[ see my comment below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fgy7rg/im_dr_ali_raja_vice_chair_of_the_department_of/fk85kml/). Asthma certainly is a concerning issue, regardless of coronavirus so it's important to try to get your asthma under control and watch carefully for symptoms of shortness of breath.
## Question:  When should schools be closing? We have 5 cases already in/near my city.


We're not public health officials, so really can't be commenting on when schools should close.  However, my two kids are still in school today, and will be as long as our public schools stay open.

I do want to mention that closing schools has a HUGE impact on us and everyone in healthcare.  Both my wife and I work in healthcare... if our schools close, how do we both continue to see patients when one of us has to stay home with the kids?  Sure, we can afford sitters, but demand is high and - more importantly - many of our coworkers (from nurses to the very important environmental staff that disinfect rooms of infected patients) often cannot.  The decision to close schools can have far-reaching impact beyond the kids who are students at them.

## Question:  I have well-controlled asthma but get a chest infection almost every winter and was hospitalised with pneumonia as a child. Aside from taking the same hygiene precautions as everyone else, is there anything I should be watching out for if I do get infected? I don’t want to go to the hospital unnecessarily if I just get a cough but I also don’t want to, you know, die.


There’s two separate issues here, one is the shortness of breath you get from COVID, and the second is shortness of breath from Asthma. They can certainly go hand in hand and as you probably know from living with it, infections can exacerbate asthma. Specifically for COVID-19, people generally develop signs and symptoms, including mild respiratory symptoms and fever, on an average of 5-6 days after infection (mean incubation period 5-6 days, range 1-14 days). 

On top of that, you might actually start feeling short of breath because of asthma. We can definitely treat that--with steroids and nebulizers. You should make sure you keep these handy. If you start feeling more short of breath and your usual treatments (steroids, nebulizers) aren’t helping the way they normally do with your asthma (after all, you know your disease well!), call your doctor to get checked out. If you feel worse quickly, go directly to the hospital as asthma is still an emergency. We’ll answer the other symptoms question separately because its actually quite interesting and informative

**TL;DR: If it feels like your typical asthma attack, it probably is.  If it doesn’t improve, call your doctor or head to the hospital. Asthma is still an emergency**
## Question:  Do you see any value in taking vitamins as a precautionary measure? I'm currently taking Vitamins C & D, Zinc and Elderberry. Figure it couldn't hurt, just wondering if it's worth recommending to others.


So I actually looked this up for recent [Parents.com](https://www.parents.com/health/healthy-happy-kids/is-elderberry-really-good-for-kids-heres-what-parents-need-to-know/) piece. There actually is some evidence that Elderberry makes symptoms of a cold more tolerable, but there is no evidence it prevents infections. Keep in mind it also has to be boiled to prevent cyanide toxicity.

I think this whole discussion gets to two main points

1) I think in medicine we need to do a better job talking about patient-reported outcomes, or how you feel. We don’t have a lot of data on medicines and treatments that just make people feel better. I fully acknowledge that, but at the same time  I have been seeing a lot of talk about the idea of boosting your immune system, but keep in mind that a lot of the reasons why people get respiratory distress is that the immune system is too activated, causing a cytokine storm and causing death. A really overactive immune system is really quite harmful (Shuhan).
 
2) I think its more useful to talk about what makes you feel better, and what prevents illness, rather than what boosts your immune system.
In general, none of the home/over-the-counter medications you will take have yet been shown to decrease the duration of symptoms of COVID-19. 

They may, however, help you with your symptoms.  Decongestants may help with your nasal congestion and your cough, and anti-inflammatory medications (like acetaminophen and ibuprofen) will help with your fever.  

3) While vitamin supplements haven’t been shown to help either, there is currently a trial being proposed in Wuhan looking at high-dose Vitamin C and whether it helps patients who are severely ill.  However, the patients will receive 24 grams of IV vitamin C per day for 7 days. That's more than 260 times the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin C for adults and children age 4 years old and up, which is 90 mg per day.  I would caution everyone to NOT take anywhere close to this dose at home, and that vitamin C has not been proven to help patients with other forms of sepsis (a life threatening infection), but it still bears further study. If you get to this point, its probably better to come to the hospital. 

**TL;DR: Lots of medications help your symptoms. No medications really treat the root cause. Take medications because they make you feel better, not for your immune system.**
## Question:  I continue to hear mixed advice on the use of masks. Some outlets have recommended against using them. Others say it can reduce my chances of getting COVID-19. What is the complete answer about masks and COVID-19?

Masks can definitely decrease the risk for infection from COVID-19.  The thought is that it is transmitted via large droplets, which a mask should help prevent.  HOWEVER, we have a shortage of masks worldwide, so rather than making a large purchase of masks if you are young and healthy, it’s best to try to leave them for older patients or those with significant medical illnesses. Thats why you may be hearing mixed messages. We really need them for people who are at high risk of death and contracting COVID.

The reports about masks not working are really based around the fact that - at this time - the evidence is that more restrictive N-95 masks are necessary to prevent the virus’ transmission (this may change - we’ll be watching the CDC’s webpage for those of us in the U.S.).  These require specific fitting, as there are different sizes.  The surgical masks you see most people wearing don’t actually limit much airflow and may - instead - offer a false sense of security.  

**TL;DR: If you’re young and healthy, don’t bother with a mask, if you need one, wear it, but wear it correctly.**

## Question:  How much stock do you take in the statement yesterday that in 10 days hospitals are going to be overrun?

I am very concerned about the capacity of the US hospital system to treat the people most in need. Its why we're doing this AMA!

## Question:  How are pregnant women or newborns affected by this virus? Should I be even more concerned about them, and their safety? -My child isn't born yet, But could be in the next few weeks.

Thank you.


At this time, very little is known about COVID-19, particularly related to its effect on pregnant women and infants/newborns. There are two sources that we look at for this, and we’re all still making best informed guesses right now. Keep in mind we have limited data sets here to make decisions off of. However this question really is three separate questions that we’ll answer separately


**1) Are pregnant women at higher risk for severe disease?**

We look at The JAMA report from the 72,000 cases in Wuhan china 

“As opposed to Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, pregnant women do not appear to be at higher risk of severe disease. In an investigation of 147 pregnant women (64 confirmed, 82 suspected and 1 asymptomatic), 8% had severe disease and 1% were critical.”

However ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) looked at limited data from previous viruses like SARS and MERS (and COVID-19 is often thought of as SARS-2). Based on this, they may be a higher risk. Additionally, there is some data that suggests that there may have been cases of preterm birth in women in China who were infected with COVID-19. 

**TL;DR Right now we just don’t know how bad the risk is, so your friend should take (or not take) whatever action makes her feel more comfortable. As you can see its a bit contradictory.**

**2) Should I breastfeed?**

ACOG recommends against breastfeeding, as the concern is for respiratory droplet transmission during feeding. There has been no evidence to date yet showing transmission of virus in breastmilk. There have been a small number of cases in china where infants were found to test positive for the virus shortly after birth but it is unknown if this was from transplacental, droplet, or breast milk transmission. 

**TLDR Keep away from breastfeeding, not because of the milk, but because you would cough and sneeze on your baby.**


**3) Will this affect my baby?**

If we use old models like radiation, fetuses tend to be most susceptible to issues in the first trimester, but by the third trimester, since they’re mostly fully formed, it's probably safe. The highest infection rate in fetuses is in the first trimester for viruses and we’re thinking about it in those terms until better evidence proves or disproves us. At this point there is just no way to know.

**Overall TL;DR It’s probably safe, we think. The only way to know is once we start taking care of more children with COVID-19, so that we can track how they were infected. Don't breastfeed if you're sick**

## Question:  Should people who smoke be really worried? I'm in the UK and a large proportion of my family are smokers. How does coronovirus impact those who smoke?


/u/Bean9661 unfortunately smoking does seem to be a risk factor for developing severe disease. Please be safe and watch your symptoms carefully. If you are having shortness of breath, please see a doctor!

## Question:  How do you self quarantine basically? What is the time period for that and what happens if you exceed that time period without any noticeable improvements?


So, first, some definitions.  Remember that quarantine isolates people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 to see if they get sick, whereas isolation is a way to separate an already sick person from people who aren't sick. Quarantines last for as long as the upper limit of the virus' incubation (the time between being exposed and showing symptoms), which the CDC is saying should be 14 days.  After that, if you’re still not showing any symptoms, you should be in the clear. Isolation lasts for as long as the virus is contagious, which means until people are free of symptoms and test negative for the virus


So specifically to answer the question how do you self quarantine if you’ve been asked to do so? 

* Stay away from other people in your home as much as possible, staying in a separate room and using a separate bathroom if available.

* No visitors unless the person needs to be in your home. Especially visitors who are elderly and frail.

* If you need medical attention (whether it’s for COVID-19 symptoms or for any other medical emergency), call ahead to ensure you're going to the right place and so that they can take the necessary precautions to isolate you when you arrive. Tell the EMT and tell the doctors early so we don't get sick from you!

* Wear a face mask if you must be around other people, such as during a drive to the doctor's office (We're answering the face mask question in another area)

* Avoid sharing household items, including drinking cups, eating utensils, towels or even bedding. Wash these items thoroughly after using.

* Clean high-touch surfaces daily using a household cleaner or wipe. These include: "counters, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables," the CDC says.[ Shuhan did a piece about it here,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-phones-ya-filthy-animals-232103183.html) I'll cite the table in another answer. The virus can stay on surfaces for 6-9 days! 

* Clean any surfaces that may be contaminated with blood, stool or any bodily fluids. This should be obvious for any situation, not just COVID

* This one is really important: Continue monitoring your symptoms. If they worsen, such as you if you begin to have difficulty breathing,, and especially if you have trouble breathing while speaking ,that is your sign to go to the ER immediately. 

- Keep in mind: when you begin the quarantine, you should have one set up for you to check in with regularly. Worst case is you are alone in an emergency.

**TL;DR Stay away from people, clean spaces you cough on, but have someone check in on you every once in a while**

## Question:  If I think I have COVID-19, what should my first few steps be to get treated and prevent spreading it to others?
/u/vivagliazzurri1116 self-quarantine! [see our comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fgy7rg/im_dr_ali_raja_vice_chair_of_the_department_of/fk89r8n/)
