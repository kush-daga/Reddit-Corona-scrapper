# Reddit-Corona-scrapper
So i was going through the coronavirus subreddit and found a really important post by Dr. Ali Raja and Dr. Shuhan He. They had an ama regarding various questions people could have about the new COVID19 and they handled it perfectly by giving really important tips. So when i was going through it I found out that it was really cluttered with all the questions and comments and replies, so i decided to use my coding skills to build a simple python script that takes in all the questions from the subreddit and displays only those which have an answer from the official author(or the docs).
